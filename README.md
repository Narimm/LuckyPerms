LuckyPerms is an advanced permissions implementation aiming to be a fast, reliable and flexible alternative to existing permission plugins. It is a fork of the LuckPerms project...that well quite frankly is just luckier!!!!.

The project's main goals are centered around high performance and a wide feature set, filling the gaps of functionality and building upon existing features found in other plugins  but in a really lucky way!!!

LuckyPerms also includes an extensive API for developers, and support for a variety of Minecraft server software & data storage options.  However in our case you will be "LUCKY" if it works

Still not convinced? More information can be found on the wiki, under:
